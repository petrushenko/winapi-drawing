## TASK

Studying the event architect of Windows applications, the message processing mechanism, the window redraw mechanism.

- Develop a program that allows you to move a sprite (colored rectangle or ellipse) inside the window's working area using the keyboard and mouse.
- Ensure the operation of the mouse wheel. Scrolling moves the sprite vertically. With the Shift key held down, scrolling the wheel moves the sprite horizontally.
- Replace the sprite with a picture with a non-rectangular outline.
- Give the sprite movement with a rebound from the borders of the window.
